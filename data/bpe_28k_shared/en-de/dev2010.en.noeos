âAnd âdo âyou âknow âwhat âthe âanswer âto âthis âquestion ânow âis ?
âThe âanswer âis â" No ."
âIt âis ânot âpossible âto âbuy âa âcell âphone âthat âdoesn ' t âdo âtoo âmuch .
âSo , âin âother âaspects âof âlife âthat âare âmuch âmore âsignificant âthan âbuying âthings , âthe âsame âexplosion âof âchoice âis âtrue .

âThere ' s âenormous âmarketing âof âprescription âdrugs âto âpeople âlike âyou âand âme , âwhich , âif âyou âthink âabout âit , âmakes âno âsense âat âall , âsince âwe âcan ' t âbuy âthem .
âWhy âdo âthey âmarket âto âus âif âwe âcan ' t âbuy âthem ?
âThe âanswer âis âthat âthey âexpect âus âto âcall âour âdoctors âthe ânext âmorning âand âask âfor âour âpres criptions âto âbe âchanged .

âAnd âthat âmeans âthat âeveryday , âwhen âyou âwake âup âin âthe âmorning , âyou âhave âto âdecide âwhat âkind âof âperson âyou âwant âto âbe .
âWith ârespect âto âmarriage âand âfamily , âthere âwas âa âtime âwhen âthe âdefault âassumption âthat âalmost âeveryone âhad âis âthat âyou âgot âmarried âas âsoon âas âyou âcould , âand âthen âyou âstarted âhaving âkids âas âsoon âas âyou âcould .
âThe âonly âreal âchoice âwas âwho , ânot âwhen , âand ânot âwhat âyou âdid âafter .

âIt ' s âbecause âthey âare âpre oc cup ied , âasking âthemselves , â" Sh ould âI âget âmarried âor ânot ? âShould âI âget âmarried ânow ?

âAnd âindeed âthey âshould . âThese âare âimportant âquestions âto âanswer .
âWork â-- âwe âare âblessed , âas âCarl âwas âpointing âout , âwith âthe âtechnology âthat âenables âus âto âwork âevery âminute âof âevery âday âfrom âany âplace âon âthe âplanet â-- âexcept âthe âRand olph âHotel .

âI ' m ânot âtelling âyou âabout âit âbecause âI âwant âto âuse âit .
âSo âwhat âthis âmeans , âthis âincredible âfreedom âof âchoice âwe âhave âwith ârespect âto âwork , âis âthat âwe âhave âto âmake âa âdecision , âagain âand âagain âand âagain , âabout âwhether âwe âshould âor âshouldn ' t âbe âworking .
âWe âcan âgo âto âwatch âour âkid âplay âsoccer , âand âwe âhave âour âcell âphone âon âone âhip , âand âour âBlack berry âon âour âother âhip , âand âour âlaptop , âpresum ably , âon âour âl aps .

âSo âeverywhere âwe âlook , âbig âthings âand âsmall âthings , âmaterial âthings âand âlifestyle âthings , âlife âis âa âmatter âof âchoice .
âAnd âthe âworld âwe âused âto âlive âin âlooked âlike âthis .
âThat âis âto âsay , âthere âwere âsome âchoices , âbut ânot âeverything âwas âa âmatter âof âchoice .
âAnd âthe âworld âwe ânow âlive âin âlooks âlike âthis .
âAnd âthe âquestion âis , âis âthis âgood ânews , âor âbad ânews ?
âAnd âthe âanswer âis âyes .
âWe âall âknow âwhat ' s âgood âabout âit , âso âI ' m âgoing âto âtalk âabout âwhat ' s âbad âabout âit .
âAll âof âthis âchoice âhas âtwo âeffects , âtwo ânegative âeffects âon âpeople .
âOne âeffect , âparadox ically , âis âthat âit âproduces âpar alysis , ârather âthan âliber ation .
âWith âso âmany âoptions âto âchoose âfrom , âpeople âfind âit âvery âdifficult âto âchoose âat âall .
âI ' ll âgive âyou âone âvery âdramatic âexample âof âthis : âa âstudy âthat âwas âdone âof âinvestments âin âvoluntary âretirement âplans .
âA âcolleague âof âmine âgot âaccess âto âinvestment ârecords âfrom âV ang u ard , âthe âgigantic âmutual âfund âcompany âof âabout âa âmillion âemployees âand âabout â2,000 âdifferent âwork pl aces .

âDan âGilbert âmade âa âbig âpoint âthis âmorning âof âtalking âabout âhow âmuch âthe âway âin âwhich âwe âvalue âthings âdepends âon âwhat âwe âcompare âthem âto .
âWell , âwhen âthere âare âlots âof âalternatives âto âconsider , âit âis âeasy âto âimagine âthe âattractive âfeatures âof âalternatives âthat âyou âreject , âthat âmake âyou âless âsatisf ied âwith âthe âalternative âthat âyou ' ve âchosen .

âAnd âthe âmore âoptions âthere âare âto âconsider , âthe âmore âattractive âfeatures âof âthese âoptions âare âgoing âto âbe âreflected âby âus âas âopportunity âcosts .
âHere ' s âanother âexample .
âNow âthis âcartoon âmakes âa âlot âof âpoints .
âIt âmakes âpoints âabout âliving âin âthe âmoment âas âwell , âand âprobably âabout âdoing âthings âslowly .
âBut âone âpoint âit âmakes âis âthat âwhenever âyou ' re âchoosing âone âthing , âyou ' re âchoosing ânot âto âdo âother âthings .

âThird : âescal ation âof âexpectations .
âThis âhit âme âwhen âI âwent âto âreplace âmy âje ans .
âI âwear âje ans âalmost âall âthe âtime .

âHe âhad âno âidea âwhat âthat âwas , âso âI âspent âan âhour âtrying âon âall âthese âdamn âje ans , âand âI âwalked âout âof âthe âstore â-- âtruth ! â-- âwith âthe âbest - f itting âje ans âI âhad âever âhad .
âI âdid âbetter . âAll âthis âchoice âmade âit âpossible âfor âme âto âdo âbetter .
âBut âI âfelt âworse .
âWhy ? âI âwrote âa âwhole âbook âto âtry âto âexplain âthis âto âmyself .
âThe âreason âI âfelt âworse âis âthat , âwith âall âof âthese âoptions âavailable , âmy âexpectations âabout âhow âgood âa âpair âof âje ans âshould âbe âwent âup .
âI âhad âvery âlow â-- âI âhad âno âparticular âexpectations âwhen âthey âonly âcame âin âone âflavor .
âWhen âthey âcame âin â100 âfl av ors , âdamn âit , âone âof âthem âshould ' ve âbeen âperfect .
âAnd âwhat âI âgot âwas âgood , âbut âit âwasn ' t âperfect .
âAnd âso âI âcompared âwhat âI âgot âto âwhat âI âexpected , âand âwhat âI âgot âwas âdisappoint ing âin âcomparison âto âwhat âI âexpected .
âAd ding âoptions âto âpeople ' s âlives âcan ' t âhelp âbut âincrease âthe âexpectations âpeople âhave âabout âhow âgood âthose âoptions âwill âbe .
âAnd âwhat âthat ' s âgoing âto âproduce âis âless âsatisfaction âwith âresults , âeven âwhen âthey ' re âgood âresults .
âNobody âin âthe âworld âof âmarketing âknows âthis , âbecause âif âthey âdid , âyou âwouldn ' t âall âknow âwhat âthis âwas âabout .
âThe âtruth âis âmore âlike âthis .
âThe âreason âthat âeverything âwas âbetter âback âwhen âeverything âwas âworse âis âthat âwhen âeverything âwas âworse , âit âwas âactually âpossible âfor âpeople âto âhave âexperiences âthat âwere âa âpleasant âsurprise .
âNow adays , âthe âworld âwe âlive âin â-- âwe âaff lu ent , âindustrial ized âcitizens , âwith âperfect ion âthe âexpectation â-- âthe âbest âyou âcan âever âhope âfor âis âthat âstuff âis âas âgood âas âyou âexpect âit âto âbe .
âYou âwill ânever âbe âpleas antly âsurprised âbecause âyour âexpectations , âmy âexpectations , âhave âgone âthrough âthe âroof .
âThe âsecret âto âhappiness â-- âthis âis âwhat âyou âall âcame âfor â-- âthe âsecret âto âhappiness âis âlow âexpectations .
âI âwant âto âsay â-- âjust âa âlittle âautobi ograph ical âmoment â-- âthat âI âactually âam âmarried âto âa âwife , âand âshe ' s âreally âquite âwonderful .
âI âcouldn ' t âhave âdone âbetter . âI âdidn ' t âsettle .
âBut âsett ling âisn ' t âalways âsuch âa âbad âthing .
âFinally , âone âconsequence âof âbuying âa âbad - f itting âpair âof âje ans âwhen âthere âis âonly âone âkind âto âbuy âis âthat âwhen âyou âare âdiss at isf ied , âand âyou âask âwhy , âwho ' s âresponsible , âthe âanswer âis âclear : âthe âworld âis âresponsible . âWhat âcould âyou âdo ?
âWhen âthere âare âhundreds âof âdifferent âst y les âof âje ans âavailable , âand âyou âbuy âone âthat âis âdisappoint ing , âand âyou âask âwhy , âwho ' s âresponsible ?
âIt âis âequally âclear âthat âthe âanswer âto âthe âquestion âis âyou .
âYou âcould âhave âdone âbetter .
âWith âa âhundred âdifferent âkinds âof âje ans âon âdisplay , âthere âis âno âexcuse âfor âfailure .
âAnd âso âwhen âpeople âmake âdecisions , âand âeven âthough âthe âresults âof âthe âdecisions âare âgood , âthey âfeel âdisappointed âabout âthem ; âthey âblame âthemselves .
âCl in ical âdepression âhas âexploded âin âthe âindustrial âworld âin âthe âlast âgeneration .
âI âbelieve âa âsignificant â-- ânot âthe âonly , âbut âa âsignificant â-- âcontrib ut or âto âthis âexplosion âof âdepression , âand âalso âsuicide , âis âthat âpeople âhave âexperiences âthat âare âdisappoint ing âbecause âtheir âstandards âare âso âhigh , âand âthen âwhen âthey âhave âto âexplain âthese âexperiences âto âthemselves , âthey âthink âthey ' re âat âfault .
âAnd âso âthe ânet âresult âis âthat âwe âdo âbetter âin âgeneral , âobject ively , âand âwe âfeel âworse .
âSo âlet âme âremind âyou .

âThere ' s âno âquestion âthat âsome âchoice âis âbetter âthan ânone , âbut âit âdoesn ' t âfollow âfrom âthat âthat âmore âchoice âis âbetter âthan âsome âchoice .

âYou âknow , âI ' ve âtalked âabout âsome âof âthese âprojects âbefore â-- âabout âthe âhuman âgenome âand âwhat âthat âmight âmean , âand âdiscovering ânew âsets âof âgenes .
âWe ' re âactually âstarting âat âa ânew âpoint : âwe ' ve âbeen âdigit izing âbiology , âand ânow âwe ' re âtrying âto âgo âfrom âthat âdigital âcode âinto âa ânew âphase âof âbiology âwith âdesigning âand âsynthes izing âlife .
âSo , âwe ' ve âalways âbeen âtrying âto âask âbig âquestions .
â" What âis âlife ?" âis âsomething âthat âI âthink âmany âbiologists âhave âbeen âtrying âto âunderstand âat âvarious âlevels .
âWe ' ve âtried âvarious âapproaches , âpar ing âit âdown âto âminimal âcomponents .
âWe ' ve âbeen âdigit izing âit ânow âfor âalmost â20 âyears ; âwhen âwe âsequenced âthe âhuman âgenome , âit âwas âgoing âfrom âthe âanalog âworld âof âbiology âinto âthe âdigital âworld âof âthe âcomputer .
âNow âwe ' re âtrying âto âask , â" Can âwe âregenerate âlife âor âcan âwe âcreate ânew âlife âout âof âthis âdigital âuniverse ?"
âThis âis âthe âmap âof âa âsmall âorganism , âMy c op las ma âgen ital ium , âthat âhas âthe âsmallest âgenome âfor âa âspecies âthat âcan âself - re plic ate âin âthe âlaboratory , âand âwe ' ve âbeen âtrying âto âjust âsee âif âwe âcan âcome âup âwith âan âeven âsmaller âgenome .
âWe ' re âable âto âknock âout âon âthe âorder âof â100 âgenes âout âof âthe â500 âor âso âthat âare âhere .
âWhen âwe âlook âat âits âmetabolic âmap , âit ' s ârelatively âsimple âcompared âto âours â-- âtrust âme , âthis âis âsimple â-- âbut âwhen âwe âlook âat âall âthe âgenes âthat âwe âcan âknock âout âone âat âa âtime , âit ' s âvery âunlikely âthat âthis âwould âyield âa âliving âcell .
âSo âwe âdecided âthe âonly âway âforward âwas âto âactually âsynthes ize âthis âchromosome âso âwe âcould âvary âthe âcomponents âto âask âsome âof âthese âmost âfundamental âquestions .
âAnd âso âwe âstarted âdown âthe âroad âof : âcan âwe âsynthes ize âa âchromosome ?
âCan âchemistry âper mit âmaking âthese âreally âlarge âmolecules âwhere âwe ' ve ânever âbeen âbefore ?
âAnd âif âwe âdo , âcan âwe âbo ot âup âa âchromosome ?
âA âchromosome , âby âthe âway , âis âjust âa âpiece âof âinert âchemical âmaterial .
âSo , âour âpace âof âdigit izing âlife âhas âbeen âincreasing âat âan âexponential âpace .
âOur âability âto âwrite âthe âgenetic âcode âhas âbeen âmoving âpretty âslowly âbut âhas âbeen âincreasing , âand âour âlatest âpoint âwould âput âit âon , ânow , âan âexponential âcurve .
âWe âstarted âthis âover â15 âyears âago .
âIt âtook âseveral âstages , âin âfact , âstarting âwith âa âbio eth ical âreview âbefore âwe âdid âthe âfirst âexperiments .
âBut âit âturns âout âsynthes izing âDNA âis âvery âdifficult .
âThere âare âtens âof âthousands âof âmachines âaround âthe âworld âthat âmake âsmall âpieces âof âDNA â-- â30 âto â50 âletters âin âlength â-- âand âit ' s âa âde gener ate âprocess , âso âthe âlonger âyou âmake âthe âpiece , âthe âmore âerrors âthere âare .
âSo âwe âhad âto âcreate âa ânew âmethod âfor âputting âthese âlittle âpieces âtogether âand âcorrect âall âthe âerrors .
âAnd âthis âwas âour âfirst âattempt , âstarting âwith âthe âdigital âinformation âof âthe âgenome âof âph i âX 1 7 4.
âIt ' s âa âsmall âvirus âthat âkills âbacteria .
âWe âdesigned âthe âpieces , âwent âthrough âour âerror âcorre ction âand âhad âa âDNA âmolecule âof âabout â5,000 âletters .
âThe âexciting âphase âcame âwhen âwe âtook âthis âpiece âof âinert âchemical âand âput âit âin âthe âbacteria , âand âthe âbacteria âstarted âto âread âthis âgenetic âcode , âmade âthe âviral âparticles .
âThe âviral âparticles âthen âwere âreleased âfrom âthe âcells âand âcame âback âand âkilled âthe âE . âcol i .
âI âwas âtalking âto âthe âoil âindustry ârecently âand âI âsaid âthey âclearly âunderstood âthat âmodel .
âThey âlaughed âmore âthan âyou âguys âare .
âAnd âso , âwe âthink âthis âis âa âsituation âwhere âthe âsoftware âcan âactually âbuild âits âown âhardware âin âa âbiological âsystem .
âBut âwe âwanted âto âgo âmuch âlarger : âwe âwanted âto âbuild âthe âentire âbacterial âchromosome â-- âit ' s âover â5 80 ,000 âletters âof âgenetic âcode â-- âso âwe âthought âwe ' d âbuild âthem âin âc ass ett es âthe âsize âof âthe âviruses âso âwe âcould âactually âvary âthe âc ass ett es âto âunderstand âwhat âthe âactual âcomponents âof âa âliving âcell âare .
âDesign âis âcritical , âand âif âyou ' re âstarting âwith âdigital âinformation âin âthe âcomputer , âthat âdigital âinformation âhas âto âbe âreally âaccurate .
âWhen âwe âfirst âsequenced âthis âgenome âin â1995, âthe âstandard âof âaccuracy âwas âone âerror âper â10,000 âbase âpairs .
âWe âactually âfound , âon âr ese quen cing âit , â30 âerrors ; âhad âwe âused âthat âoriginal âsequence , âit ânever âwould âhave âbeen âable âto âbe âboo ted âup .
âPart âof âthe âdesign âis âdesigning âpieces âthat âare â50 âletters âlong âthat âhave âto âoverl ap âwith âall âthe âother â50- letter âpieces âto âbuild âsmaller âsub un its âwe âhave âto âdesign âso âthey âcan âgo âtogether .
âWe âdesign âunique âelements âinto âthis .
âYou âmay âhave âread âthat âwe âput âwater mark s âin .
âThink âof âthis : âwe âhave âa âfour - letter âgenetic âcode â-- âA , âC , âG âand âT .
âTri ple ts âof âthose âletters âcode âfor âroughly â20 âam ino âacids , âsuch âthat âthere ' s âa âsingle âletter âdesign ation âfor âeach âof âthe âam ino âacids .
âSo âwe âcan âuse âthe âgenetic âcode âto âwrite âout âwords , âsentences , âthoughts .
âIniti ally , âall âwe âdid âwas âaut ograph âit .
âSome âpeople âwere âdisappointed âthere âwas ânot âpoetry .
âWe âdesigned âthese âpieces âso âwe âcan âjust âche w âback âwith âen zym es ; âthere âare âen zym es âthat ârepair âthem âand âput âthem âtogether .
âAnd âwe âstarted âmaking âpieces , âstarting âwith âpieces âthat âwere â5,000 âto â7,000 âletters , âput âthose âtogether âto âmake â24 ,000 - letter âpieces , âthen âput âsets âof âthose âgoing âup âto â72 ,000.
âAt âeach âstage , âwe âgrew âup âthese âpieces âin âabundance âso âwe âcould âsequence âthem âbecause âwe ' re âtrying âto âcreate âa âprocess âthat ' s âextremely ârobust âthat âyou âcan âsee âin âa âminute .
âWe ' re âtrying âto âget âto âthe âpoint âof âautom ation .
âSo , âthis âlooks âlike âa âbasketball âplay off .
âWhen âwe âget âinto âthese âreally âlarge âpieces âover â100,000 âbase âpairs , âthey âwon ' t âany âlonger âgrow âread ily âin âE . âcol i â-- âit âexhaus ts âall âthe âmodern âtools âof âmolecular âbiology â-- âand âso âwe âturned âto âother âmechanisms .
âWe âknew âthere ' s âa âmechanism âcalled âhom olog ous ârec omb ination âthat âbiology âuses âto ârepair âDNA âthat âcan âput âpieces âtogether .
âHere ' s âan âexample âof âit : âthere ' s âan âorganism âcalled âDein oc oc cus ârad iod ur ans âthat âcan âtake âthree âmillions âra ds âof âradiation .
âYou âcan âsee âin âthe âtop âpanel , âits âchromosome âjust âgets âblown âapart .
âTw el ve âto â24 âhours âlater , âit âput âit âback âtogether âexactly âas âit âwas âbefore .
âWe âhave âthousands âof âorganisms âthat âcan âdo âthis .
âThese âorganisms âcan âbe âtotally âdes ic c ated ; âthey âcan âlive âin âa âvacuum .
âI âam âabsolutely âcertain âthat âlife âcan âexist âin âouter âspace , âmove âaround , âfind âa ânew âa que ous âenvironment .
âIn âfact , âNASA âhas âshown âa âlot âof âthis âis âout âthere .
âHere ' s âan âactual âmicro graph âof âthe âmolecule âwe âbuilt âusing âthese âprocesses , âactually âjust âusing âyeast âmechanisms âwith âthe âright âdesign âof âthe âpieces âwe âput âthem âin ; âyeast âputs âthem âtogether âautomatically .
âThis âis ânot âan âelectron âmicro graph ; âthis âis âjust âa âregular âphot om icro graph .
âIt ' s âsuch âa âlarge âmolecule âwe âcan âsee âit âwith âa âlight âmicroscope .
âThese âare âpictures âover âabout âa âsix - second âperiod .
âSo , âthis âis âthe âpublic ation âwe âhad âjust âa âshort âwhile âago .
âThis âis âover â5 80 ,000 âletters âof âgenetic âcode ; âit ' s âthe âlargest âmolecule âever âmade âby âhumans âof âa âdefined âstructure .
âIt ' s âover â300 âmillion âmolecular âweight .
âIf âwe âprinted âit âout âat âa â10 âfont âwith âno âsp acing , âit âtakes â14 2 âpages âjust âto âprint âthis âgenetic âcode .
âWell , âhow âdo âwe âbo ot âup âa âchromosome ? âHow âdo âwe âactivate âthis ?
âObviously , âwith âa âvirus âit ' s âpretty âsimple ; âit ' s âmuch âmore âcomplicated âdealing âwith âbacteria .
âIt ' s âalso âsimpler âwhen âyou âgo âinto âe uk ary otes âlike âourselves : âyou âcan âjust âpop âout âthe ânucleus âand âpop âin âanother âone , âand âthat ' s âwhat âyou ' ve âall âheard âabout âwith âcl oning .
âWith âbacteria âand âArch ae a , âthe âchromosome âis âintegrated âinto âthe âcell , âbut âwe ârecently âshowed âthat âwe âcan âdo âa âcomplete âtransplant âof âa âchromosome âfrom âone âcell âto âanother âand âactivate âit .
âWe âpur ified âa âchromosome âfrom âone âmicrobial âspecies â-- âroughly , âthese âtwo âare âas âdistant âas âhuman âand âmice â-- âwe âadded âa âfew âextra âgenes âso âwe âcould âselect âfor âthis âchromosome , âwe âd iges ted âit âwith âen zym es âto âkill âall âthe âproteins , âand âit âwas âpretty âstunning âwhen âwe âput âthis âin âthe âcell â-- âand âyou ' ll âappreciate âour âvery âsophisticated âgraphics âhere .
âThe ânew âchromosome âwent âinto âthe âcell .
âIn âfact , âwe âthought âthis âmight âbe âas âfar âas âit âwent , âbut âwe âtried âto âdesign âthe âprocess âa âlittle âbit âfurther .
âThis âis âa âmajor âmechanism âof âevolution âright âhere .
âWe âfind âall âkinds âof âspecies âthat âhave âtaken âup âa âsecond âchromosome âor âa âthird âone âfrom âsomewhere , âadding âthousands âof ânew âtraits âin âa âsecond âto âthat âspecies .
âSo , âpeople âwho âthink âof âevolution âas âjust âone âgene âchanging âat âa âtime âhave âmissed âmuch âof âbiology .
âThere âare âen zym es âcalled ârest r iction âen zym es âthat âactually âdigest âDNA .
âThe âchromosome âthat âwas âin âthe âcell âdoesn ' t âhave âone ; âthe âchromosome âwe âput âin âdoes .
âIt âgot âexpressed âand âit ârecognized âthe âother âchromosome âas âforeign âmaterial , âche wed âit âup , âand âso âwe âended âup âjust âwith âa âcell âwith âthe ânew âchromosome .
âIt âturned âblue âbecause âof âthe âgenes âwe âput âin âit .
âAnd âwith âa âvery âshort âperiod âof âtime , âall âthe âcharacteristics âof âone âspecies âwere âlost âand âit âconverted âtotally âinto âthe ânew âspecies âbased âon âthe ânew âsoftware âthat âwe âput âin âthe âcell .
âAll âthe âproteins âchanged , âthe âmembr anes âchanged ; âwhen âwe âread âthe âgenetic âcode , âit ' s âexactly âwhat âwe âhad âtransfer red âin .
âSo , âthis âmay âsound âlike âgen om ic âal chem y , âbut âwe âcan , âby âmoving âthe âsoftware âof âDNA âaround , âchange âthings âquite âdramatically .
âNow âI ' ve âargued , âthis âis ânot âgenes is ; âthis âis âbuilding âon âthree âand âa âhalf âbillion âyears âof âevolution .
âAnd âI ' ve âargued âthat âwe ' re âabout âto âperhaps âcreate âa ânew âversion âof âthe âCamb rian âexplosion , âwhere âthere ' s âmassive ânew âspe ci ation âbased âon âthis âdigital âdesign .
âWhy âdo âthis ?
âI âthink âthis âis âpretty âobvious âin âterms âof âsome âof âthe âneeds .
âWe ' re âabout âto âgo âfrom âsix âand âa âhalf âto ânine âbillion âpeople âover âthe ânext â40 âyears .
âTo âput âit âin âcontext âfor âmyself : âI âwas âborn âin â194 6.
âThere âare ânow âthree âpeople âon âthe âplanet âfor âevery âone âof âus âthat âexisted âin â194 6 ; âwithin â40 âyears , âthere ' ll âbe âfour .
âWe âhave âtrouble âfeeding , âproviding âfresh , âclean âwater , âmedicines , âfuel âfor âthe âsix âand âa âhalf âbillion .
âIt ' s âgoing âto âbe âa âstretch âto âdo âit âfor ânine .
âWe âuse âover âfive âbillion âtons âof âcoal , â30 âbillion - plus âbarrel s âof âoil â-- âthat ' s âa âhundred âmillion âbarrel s âa âday .

âSo , âin âa âshort âperiod âof âtime , âwe âthink âthat âwe âmight âbe âable âto âincrease âwhat âthe âbasic âquestion âis âof â" What âis âlife ?"

âIn âother âwords , âwhen âwe âsaw âthat âpicture âon âSeptember â10 th âwe âknew âthe âmachine âworked , âwhich âis âa âgreat âtriumph .
âI âdon ' t âknow âwhether âthis âgot âthe âbiggest âche er , âor âthis , âwhen âsomeone âwent âonto âGoogle âand âsaw âthe âfront âpage âwas âlike âthat .

âAbout âa âweek âlater âwe âhad âa âproblem âwith âthe âmachine , ârelated âactually âto âthese âbits âof âwire âhere â-- âthese âgold âwires .
âThose âwires âcarry â13 âthousand âam ps âwhen âthe âmachine âis âworking âin âfull âpower .

âAnd âeveryone âknew âthat âthis âis âhow âit âfunction ed , âright ?
âSo âthe âancient âartist âwas âprotected âfrom âcertain âthings , âlike , âfor âexample , âtoo âmuch ânarc iss ism , âright ?
âIf âyour âwork âwas âbrilliant âyou âcouldn ' t âtake âall âthe âcredit âfor âit , âeverybody âknew âthat âyou âhad âthis âdis em bod ied âgenius âwho âhad âhelped âyou .

âEveryone âknew âyour âgenius âwas âkind âof âl ame .
âAnd âthis âis âhow âpeople âthought âabout âcreativity âin âthe âWest âfor âa âreally âlong âtime .
âAnd âthen âthe âRenaissance âcame âand âeverything âchanged , âand âwe âhad âthis âbig âidea , âand âthe âbig âidea âwas âlet ' s âput âthe âindividual âhuman âbeing âat âthe âcenter âof âthe âuniverse âabove âall âgods âand âmysteries , âand âthere ' s âno âmore âroom âfor âmyst ical âcreatures âwho âtake âdict ation âfrom âthe âdiv ine .
âAnd âit ' s âthe âbeginning âof ârational âhuman ism , âand âpeople âstarted âto âbelieve âthat âcreativity âcame âcompletely âfrom âthe âself âof âthe âindividual .
âAnd âfor âthe âfirst âtime âin âhistory , âyou âstart âto âhear âpeople ârefer ring âto âthis âor âthat âartist âas âbeing âa âgenius ârather âthan âhaving âa âgenius .
âAnd âI âgot âto âtell âyou , âI âthink âthat âwas âa âhuge âerror .
âYou âknow , âI âthink âthat âallowing âsomebody , âone âmere âperson âto âbelieve âthat âhe âor âshe âis âlike , âthe âvessel , âyou âknow , âlike âthe âfont âand âthe âessence âand âthe âsource âof âall âdiv ine , âcreative , âun know able , âeternal âmystery âis âjust âa âsm idge âtoo âmuch âresponsibility âto âput âon âone âfragile , âhuman âp syche .
âIt ' s âlike âasking âsomebody âto âswallow âthe âsun .

âAnd âI âthink âthe âpressure âof âthat âhas âbeen âkilling âoff âour âartists âfor âthe âlast â500 âyears .
âAnd , âif âthis âis âtrue , âand âI âthink âit âis âtrue , âthe âquestion âbecomes , âwhat ânow ?
âCan âwe âdo âthis âdifferently ?
âMaybe âgo âback âto âsome âmore âancient âunderstanding âabout âthe ârelationship âbetween âhumans âand âthe âcreative âmystery .
âMaybe ânot .
âMaybe âwe âcan ' t âjust âer ase â500 âyears âof ârational âhuman istic âthought âin âone â18 âminute âspeech .
âAnd âthere ' s âprobably âpeople âin âthis âaudience âwho âwould âraise âreally âlegitimate âscientific âsusp ic ions âabout âthe ânotion âof , âbasically âfair ies âwho âfollow âpeople âaround ârub bing âfairy âjuice âon âtheir âprojects âand âstuff .

âWhy ânot âthink âabout âit âthis âway ?
âBecause âit âmakes âas âmuch âsense âas âanything âelse âI âhave âever âheard âin âterms âof âexplaining âthe âutter âmad den ing âcap ric ious ness âof âthe âcreative âprocess .

âAnd , âin âfact , âcan âsometimes âfeel âdown right âpar an orm al .
âI âhad âthis âencounter ârecently âwhere âI âmet âthe âextraordinary âAmerican âpoet âR uth âStone , âwho ' s ânow âin âher â90 s , âbut âshe ' s âbeen âa âpoet âher âentire âlife âand âshe âtold âme âthat âwhen âshe âwas âgrowing âup âin ârural âVirginia , âshe âwould âbe âout âworking âin âthe âfields , âand âshe âsaid âshe âwould âfeel âand âhear âa âpoem âcoming âat âher âfrom âover âthe âlandscape .

âSo , âshe ' s ârunning âto âthe âhouse âand âshe ' s âlooking âfor âthe âpaper âand âthe âpoem âpasses âthrough âher , âand âshe âgra bs âa âpencil âjust âas âit ' s âgoing âthrough âher , âand âthen âshe âsaid , âit âwas âlike âshe âwould âreach âout âwith âher âother âhand âand âshe âwould âcatch âit .
âShe âwould âcatch âthe âpoem âby âits âtail , âand âshe âwould âpull âit âbackwards âinto âher âbody âas âshe âwas âtransc rib ing âon âthe âpage .

âHe âjust âlooked âup âat âthe âsky , âand âhe âsaid , â" Ex cuse âme , âcan âyou ânot âsee âthat âI ' m âdriving ?"

âNot âthe âwork , âthe âwork âwas âstill âof tent imes âas âdark âas âever .
âBut âthe âprocess , âand âthe âheavy âanxiety âaround âit âwas âreleased âwhen âhe âtook âthe âgen ie , âthe âgenius âout âof âhim âwhere âit âwas âcausing ânothing âbut âtrouble , âand âreleased âit âkind âof âback âwhere âit âcame âfrom , âand ârealized âthat âthis âdidn ' t âhave âto âbe âthis âinternal ized , âtor mented âthing .
