âBut âI âwondered , âwhat âif âthere âcould âbe âno âboundary âat âall ?
âI âstarted âto âimagine âwhat âthis âwould âlook âlike .
âFirst , âI âcreated âthis âtool âwhich âpenet r ates âinto âthe âdigital âspace , âso âwhen âyou âpress âit âhard âon âthe âscreen , âit âtrans fers âits âphysical âbody âinto âpix els .

âSo âwith âthis âtool , âthis âboundary âhas âbeen âbroken .
âBut âour âtwo âhands âstill âremain âoutside âthe âscreen .
âHow âcan âyou âreach âinside âand âinteract âwith âthe âdigital âinformation âusing âthe âfull âde x ter ity âof âour âhands ?
âAt âMicrosoft âApp lied âSc iences , âalong âwith âmy âmentor âC ati âB oul anger , âI âredesign ed âthe âcomputer âand âturned âa âlittle âspace âabove âthe âkeyboard âinto âa âdigital âwork space .
âBy âcomb ining âa âtransparent âdisplay âand âdepth âcameras âfor âsensing âyour âfingers âand âface , ânow âyou âcan âlift âup âyour âhands âfrom âthe âkeyboard âand âreach âinside âthis â3 D âspace âand âgrab âpix els âwith âyour âbare âhands .
âBecause âwindows âand âfil es âhave âa âposition âin âthe âreal âspace , âsele cting âthem âis âas âeasy âas âgrab bing âa âbook âoff âyour âshelf .

âSo âin âthese âexamples , âwe âare âreaching âinto âthe âdigital âworld .
âBut âhow âabout ârevers ing âits ârole âand âhaving âthe âdigital âinformation âreach âus âinstead ?

âAt âMIT âMedia âLab , âalong âwith âmy âadv is or âHirosh i âIs hi i âand âmy âcollabor ator âRe hm i âPost , âwe âcreated âthis âone âphysical âpix el .

âSo âI âwas âtrained âto âbecome âa âg ymn ast âfor âtwo âyears âin âH un an , âChina âin âthe â1970 s .
âWhen âI âwas âin âthe âfirst âgrade , âthe âgovernment âwanted âto âtransfer âme âto âa âschool âfor âathletes , âall âexp ens es âpaid .
âBut âmy âtiger âmother âsaid , â" No ."
âMy âparents âwanted âme âto âbecome âan âengineer âlike âthem .
âAfter âsurviving âthe âC ultural âRevolution , âthey âfirm ly âbelieved âthere ' s âonly âone âsure âway âto âhappiness : âa âsafe âand âwell - pa id âjob .
âIt âis ânot âimportant âif âI âlike âthe âjob âor ânot .
âBut âmy âdream âwas âto âbecome âa âChinese âopera âsinger .
âThat âis âme âplaying âmy âimag inary âpiano .
âAn âopera âsinger âmust âstart âtraining âyoung âto âlearn âac rob atics , âso âI âtried âeverything âI âcould âto âgo âto âopera âschool .
âI âeven âwrote âto âthe âschool âprincipal âand âthe âhost âof âa âradio âshow .

âNo âadults âbelieved âI âwas âserious .
âOnly âmy âfriends âsupported âme , âbut âthey âwere âkids , âjust âas âpower less âas âI âwas .
âSo âat âage â15, âI âknew âI âwas âtoo âold âto âbe âtrained .
âMy âdream âwould ânever âcome âtrue .
âI âwas âafraid âthat âfor âthe ârest âof âmy âlife âsome âsecond - class âhappiness âwould âbe âthe âbest âI âcould âhope âfor .

âSo âI âwas âdetermined âto âfind âanother âcalling .
âNobody âaround âto âteach âme ? âF ine .
âI âturned âto âbooks .
âI âsatisf ied âmy âhunger âfor âparent al âadvice âfrom âthis âbook âby âa âfamily âof âwriters âand âmusicians .

âEn c oun ter ing âa ânew âculture âalso âstarted âmy âhabit âof âcompar ative âreading .
âIt âoffers âmany âinsights .
âFor âexample , âI âfound âthis âmap âout âof âplace âat âfirst âbecause âthis âis âwhat âChinese âstudents âgrew âup âwith .

âRobin âNag le : âWhat âI âdiscovered âin âNew âYork âCity âtrash
âI âwas âabout â10 âyears âold âon âa âcamp ing âtrip âwith âmy âdad âin âthe âAd ir ond ack âMountains , âa âwilder ness âarea âin âthe ânorthern âpart âof âNew âYork âState .
âIt âwas âa âbeautiful âday .
âThe âforest âwas âspark ling .
âThe âsun âmade âthe âleaves âglow âlike âst ained âglass , âand âif âit âweren ' t âfor âthe âpath âwe âwere âfollowing , âwe âcould âalmost âpretend âwe âwere âthe âfirst âhuman âbeings âto âever âwalk âthat âland .
âWe âgot âto âour âcamps ite .
âIt âwas âa âlean - to âon âa âbl uff âlooking âover âa âcrystal , âbeautiful âlake , âwhen âI âdiscovered âa âhorror .
âBehind âthe âlean - to âwas âa âdump , âmaybe â40 âfeet âsquare âwith ârot ting âapple âcor es âand âball ed - up âaluminum âfo il , âand âa âdead âsne aker .
âAnd âI âwas âaston ished , âI âwas âvery âangry , âand âI âwas âdeeply âconfused .
âThe âcamp ers âwho âwere âtoo âl az y âto âtake âout âwhat âthey âhad âbrought âin , âwho âdid âthey âthink âwould âclean âup âafter âthem ?
âThat âquestion âstayed âwith âme , âand âit âsimpl ified âa âlittle .
âWho âcle ans âup âafter âus ?
âHowever âyou âconf ig ure âor âwherever âyou âplace âthe âus , âwho âcle ans âup âafter âus âin âIst an bul ?
âWho âcle ans âup âafter âus âin âRio âor âin âParis âor âin âLondon ?
âHere âin âNew âYork , âthe âDepartment âof âSan itation âcle ans âup âafter âus , âto âthe âtune âof â11 ,000 âtons âof âgarbage âand â2,000 âtons âof ârecy cl ables âevery âday .
âI âwanted âto âget âto âknow âthem âas âindividuals .
âI âwanted âto âunderstand âwho âtakes âthe âjob .
âWhat ' s âit âlike âto âwear âthe âuniform âand âbear âthat âburden ?
âSo âI âstarted âa âresearch âproject âwith âthem .
âI âro de âin âthe âtrucks âand âwalked âthe ârout es âand âinterviewed âpeople âin âoffices âand âfacilities âall âover âthe âcity , âand âI âlearned âa âlot , âbut âI âwas âstill âan âouts ider .
âI âneeded âto âgo âdeeper .
âSo âI âtook âthe âjob âas âa âsanitation âworker .
âI âdidn ' t âjust âride âin âthe âtrucks ânow . âI âdrove âthe âtrucks .
âAnd âI âoperated âthe âmechanical âbro oms âand âI âpl ow ed âthe âsnow .
âIt âwas âa âremarkable âprivilege âand âan âamazing âeducation .
âEveryone âasks âabout âthe âsmell .
âIt ' s âthere , âbut âit ' s ânot âas âpre val ent âas âyou âthink , âand âon âdays âwhen âit âis âreally âbad , âyou âget âused âto âit ârather âquickly .
âThe âweight âtakes âa âlong âtime âto âget âused âto .
âI âknew âpeople âwho âwere âseveral âyears âon âthe âjob âwhose âbodies âwere âstill âadjust ing âto âthe âburden âof âbe aring âon âyour âbody âtons âof âtrash âevery âweek .
âThen âthere ' s âthe âdanger .
âAccording âto âthe âB ureau âof âLabor âStatist ics , âsanitation âwork âis âone âof âthe â10 âmost âdangerous âoccup ations âin âthe âcountry , âand âI âlearned âwhy .
âYou ' re âin âand âout âof âtraffic âall âday , âand âit ' s âz o oming âaround âyou .
âIt âjust âwants âto âget âpast âyou , âso âit ' s âoften âthe âmotor ist âis ânot âpaying âattention .
âThat ' s âreally âbad âfor âthe âworker .
âAnd âthen âthe âgarbage âitself âis âfull âof âha z ards âthat âoften âfly âback âout âof âthe âtruck âand âdo âterrible âharm .
âI âalso âlearned âabout âthe ârel ent less ness âof âtrash .
âWhen âyou âstep âoff âthe âcur b âand âyou âsee âa âcity âfrom âbehind âa âtruck , âyou âcome âto âunderstand âthat âtrash âis âlike âa âforce âof ânature âun to âitself .
âIt ânever âstops âcoming .
âIt ' s âalso âlike âa âform âof ârespir ation âor âcirculation .
âIt âmust âalways âbe âin âmotion .
âAnd âthen âthere ' s âthe âstigma .
âYou âput âon âthe âuniform , âand âyou âbecome âinvisible âuntil âsomeone âis âupset âwith âyou âfor âwhatever âreason âlike âyou ' ve âblocked âtraffic âwith âyour âtruck , âor âyou ' re âtaking âa âbreak âtoo âclose âto âtheir âhome , âor âyou ' re âdrinking âcoffee âin âtheir âd iner , âand âthey âwill âcome âand âsc orn âyou , âand âtell âyou âthat âthey âdon ' t âwant âyou âanywhere ânear âthem .
âI âfind âthe âstigma âespecially âironic , âbecause âI âstrongly âbelieve âthat âsanitation âworkers âare âthe âmost âimportant âlabor âforce âon âthe âstreets âof âthe âcity , âfor âthree âreasons .
âThey âare âthe âfirst âguard ians âof âpublic âhealth .
âIf âthey ' re ânot âtaking âaway âtrash âefficient ly âand âeffectively âevery âday , âit âstarts âto âspill âout âof âits âcontain ments , âand âthe âd angers âinherent âto âit âthreaten âus âin âvery âreal âways .
âD ise ases âwe ' ve âhad âin âcheck âfor âdecades âand âcenturies âburst âforth âagain âand âstart âto âharm âus .
âThe âeconomy âneeds âthem .
âIf âwe âcan ' t âthrow âout âthe âold âstuff , âwe âhave âno âroom âfor âthe ânew âstuff , âso âthen âthe âengines âof âthe âeconomy âstart âto âsp utter âwhen âconsumption âis âcomprom ised .
âI ' m ânot âadvoc ating âcapitalism , âI ' m âjust âpointing âout âtheir ârelationship .
âAnd âthen âthere ' s âwhat âI âcall âour âaverage , ânecessary âqu ot id ian âveloc ity .
âBy âthat âI âsimply âmean âhow âfast âwe ' re âused âto âmoving âin âthe âcontemporary âday âand âage .
âWe âusually âdon ' t âcare âfor , ârepair , âclean , âcarry âaround âour âcoffee âcup , âour âshopping âbag , âour âbottle âof âwater .
âWe âuse âthem , âwe âthrow âthem âout , âwe âforget âabout âthem , âbecause âwe âknow âthere ' s âa âworkforce âon âthe âother âside âthat ' s âgoing âto âtake âit âall âaway .
âSo âI âwant âto âsuggest âtoday âa âcouple âof âways âto âthink âabout âsanitation âthat âwill âperhaps âhelp âam el ior ate âthe âstigma âand âbring âthem âinto âthis âconversation âof âhow âto âcraft âa âcity âthat âis âsustainable âand âhuman e .
âTheir âwork , âI âthink , âis âkind âof âlit ur g ical .
âThey ' re âon âthe âstreets âevery âday , ârhythm ically .
âThey âwear âa âuniform âin âmany âcities .
âYou âknow âwhen âto âexpect âthem .
âAnd âtheir âwork âlets âus âdo âour âwork .
âThey âare âalmost âa âform âof âreass urance .
âThe âflow âthat âthey âmaintain âkeeps âus âsafe âfrom âourselves , âfrom âour âown âd ross , âour âcast - offs , âand âthat âflow âmust âbe âmaint ained âalways âno âmatter âwhat .
âOn âthe âday âafter âSeptember â11 âin â2001, âI âheard âthe âgrow l âof âa âsanitation âtruck âon âthe âstreet , âand âI âgrabbed âmy âinfant âson âand âI âran âdown stairs âand âthere âwas âa âman âdoing âhis âpaper ârecycling âroute âlike âhe âdid âevery âW ed nes day .
âAnd âI âtried âto âthank âhim âfor âdoing âhis âwork âon âthat âday âof âall âdays , âbut âI âstarted âto âcry .
âAnd âhe âlooked âat âme , âand âhe âjust ân od ded , âand âhe âsaid , â" We ' re âgoing âto âbe âokay .
âWe ' re âgoing âto âbe âokay ."
âIt âwas âa âlittle âwhile âlater âthat âI âstarted âmy âresearch âwith âsanitation , âand âI âmet âthat âman âagain .
âHis âname âis âPaul ie , âand âwe âworked âtogether âmany âtimes , âand âwe âbecame âgood âfriends .
âI âwant âto âbelieve âthat âPaul ie âwas âright .
âWe âare âgoing âto âbe âokay .
âBut âin âour âeffort âto ârecon fig ure âhow âwe âas âa âspecies âexist âon âthis âplanet , âwe âmust âinclude âand âtake âaccount âof âall âthe âcosts , âincluding âthe âvery âreal âhuman âcost âof âthe âlabor .

âI âremember âwatching âthe âlif to ff âof âApollo â17.
âI âwas âfive âyears âold , âand âmy âmother âtold âme ânot âto âstare âat âthe âfier y âexhaus t âof âa âSaturn âV ârocket .

âBut âI âdon ' t âthink âthat âexplanation âis âgood âenough .

âSometimes âwe âchoose ânot âto âsolve âbig âproblems .
âWe âcould âgo âto âMars âif âwe âwant .
âNASA âeven âhas âthe âout line âof âa âplan .
âBut âgoing âto âMars âwould âfollow âa âpolitical âdecision âwith âpopular âappeal , âand âthat âwill ânever âhappen .
âWe âwon ' t âgo âto âMars , âbecause âeveryone âthinks âthere âare âmore âimportant âthings âto âdo âhere âon âEarth .
âSometimes , âwe âcan ' t âsolve âbig âproblems âbecause âour âpolitical âsystems âfail .

âAnd âhe âwas âthis âincredibly âtragic âfigure , âbut âhe âwas âa âwindow âinto âthe âextent âto âwhich âour âmemories âmake âus âwho âwe âare .
âThe âother âend âof âthe âspectrum : âI âmet âthis âguy .

âAnd âI âlearned âa âwhole âbunch âof âreally âinteresting âstuff .
âOne âof âthe âreally âinteresting âthings âthat âI âlearned âis âthat âonce âupon âa âtime , âthis âidea âof âhaving âa âtrained , âdiscipl ined , âcult iv ated âmemory âwas ânot ânearly âso âalien âas âit âwould âseem âto âus âto âbe âtoday .
âOnce âupon âa âtime , âpeople âinvested âin âtheir âmemories , âin âlabor iously âfurn ishing âtheir âminds .
âOver âthe âlast âfew âmill en ia âwe ' ve âinvented âa âseries âof âtechnologies â-- âfrom âthe âalphabet âto âthe âscroll âto âthe âcode x , âthe âprinting âpress , âphotography , âthe âcomputer , âthe âsmartphone â-- âthat âhave âmade âit âprogress ively âeasier âand âeasier âfor âus âto âexternal ize âour âmemories , âfor âus âto âessentially âout source âthis âfundamental âhuman âcapacity .
âThese âtechnologies âhave âmade âour âmodern âworld âpossible , âbut âthey ' ve âalso âchanged âus .
âThey ' ve âchanged âus âculturally , âand âI âwould âargue âthat âthey ' ve âchanged âus âcogn itively .
âHaving âlittle âneed âto âremember âanymore , âit âsometimes âseems âlike âwe ' ve âforgotten âhow .
âOne âof âthe âlast âplaces âon âEarth âwhere âyou âstill âfind âpeople âpassionate âabout âthis âidea âof âa âtrained , âdiscipl ined , âcult iv ated âmemory âis âat âthis âtotally âsingular âmemory âcontest .
âIt ' s âactually ânot âthat âsingular , âthere âare âcont ests âheld âall âover âthe âworld .
âAnd âI âwas âfascinated , âI âwanted âto âknow âhow âdo âthese âguys âdo âit .
âA âfew âyears âback âa âgroup âof âresearchers âat âUniversity âCollege âLondon âbrought âa âbunch âof âmemory âchampions âinto âthe âlab .
âThey âwanted âto âknow : âDo âthese âguys âhave âbrains âthat âare âsomehow âstruct urally , âanatom ically âdifferent âfrom âthe ârest âof âours ?
âThe âanswer âwas âno .
âAre âthey âsmarter âthan âthe ârest âof âus ?
âThey âgave âthem âa âbunch âof âcognitive âtests , âand âthe âanswer âwas ânot âreally .
âThere âwas âhowever âone âreally âinteresting âand âtelling âdifference âbetween âthe âbrains âof âthe âmemory âchampions âand âthe âcontrol âsubjects âthat âthey âwere âcomparing âthem âto .
âWhen âthey âput âthese âguys âin âan âfM RI âmachine , âscanned âtheir âbrains âwhile âthey âwere âmemor izing ânumbers âand âpeople ' s âfaces âand âpictures âof âsnow fl akes , âthey âfound âthat âthe âmemory âchampions âwere âlighting âup âdifferent âparts âof âthe âbrain âthan âeveryone âelse .
âOf ânote , âthey âwere âusing , âor âthey âseemed âto âbe âusing , âa âpart âof âthe âbrain âthat ' s âinvolved âin âspatial âmemory âand ânavig ation .
âWhy ? âAnd âis âthere âsomething âthe ârest âof âus âcan âlearn âfrom âthis ?
âThe âsport âof âcompetitive âmemor izing âis âdriven âby âa âkind âof âarms ârace âwhere âevery âyear âsomebody âcomes âup âwith âa ânew âway âto âremember âmore âstuff âmore âquickly , âand âthen âthe ârest âof âthe âfield âhas âto âplay âcatch up .

âYeah .
âAnd âwhile âthere âare âa âwhole âhost âof âways âof âremembering âstuff âin âthese âcompet itions , âeverything , âall âof âthe âtechniques âthat âare âbeing âused , âultimately âcome âdown âto âa âconcept âthat âpsychologists ârefer âto âas âelabor ative âenc od ing .

âThe âperson âwho âwas âtold âhis âname âis âBaker âis âless âlikely âto âremember âthe âsame âword âthan âthe âperson âwas âtold âhis âjob âis âthat âhe âis âa âb aker .

âMaybe âwe âeven âknow âa âb aker .
âAnd âwhen âwe âfirst âhear âthat âword , âwe âstart âputting âthese âassoc i ational âhook s âinto âit âthat âmake âit âeasier âto âfish âit âback âout âat âsome âlater âdate .

âOne âof âthe âmore âelaborate âtechniques âfor âdoing âthis âdates âback â2, 500 âyears âto âAn c ient âGreece .
âIt âcame âto âbe âknown âas âthe âmemory âpal ace .
âThe âstory âbehind âits âcreation âgoes âlike âthis : âThere âwas âa âpoet âcalled âSimon ides âwho âwas âattend ing âa âban qu et .
âHe âwas âactually âthe âhired âentertainment , âbecause âback âthen âif âyou âwanted âto âthrow âa âreally âsl amm ing âparty , âyou âdidn ' t âhire âa âD . J ., âyou âhired âa âpoet .
âAnd âhe âstands âup , âdelivers âhis âpoem âfrom âmemory , âwalks âout âthe âdoor , âand âat âthe âmoment âhe âdoes , âthe âban qu et âhall âcollaps es , âkills âeverybody âinside .
âIt âdoesn ' t âjust âkill âeverybody , âit âman gles âthe âbodies âbeyond âall ârecognition .
âNobody âcan âsay âwho âwas âinside , ânobody âcan âsay âwhere âthey âwere âsitting .
âThe âbodies âcan ' t âbe âproperly âburied .
âIt ' s âone âtragedy âcomp ounding âanother .
âSimon ides , âstanding âoutside , âthe âsole âsurviv or âam id âthe âw reck age , âclos es âhis âeyes âand âhas âthis ârealization , âwhich âis âthat âin âhis âmind ' s âeye , âhe âcan âsee âwhere âeach âof âthe âgu ests âat âthe âban qu et âhad âbeen âsitting .

âWhat âSimon ides âfigured âout âat âthat âmoment âis âsomething âthat âI âthink âwe âall âkind âof âintuit ively âknow , âwhich âis âthat , âas âbad âas âwe âare âat âremembering ânames âand âphone ânumbers âand âword - for - word âinstructions âfrom âour âcolleagues , âwe âhave âreally âexception al âvisual âand âspatial âmemories .

âThe âproblem âwas âthat âa âmemory âcontest âis âa âpath ologically âboring âevent .

âI âwent âto âteach âseventh âgra ders âmath âin âthe âNew âYork âCity âpublic âschools .
âAnd âlike âany âteacher , âI âmade âqu izz es âand âtests .
âI âgave âout âhomework âassign ments .
âWhen âthe âwork âcame âback , âI âcalculated âgrades .
âWhat âstruck âme âwas âthat âI . Q . âwas ânot âthe âonly âdifference âbetween âmy âbest âand âmy âworst âstudents .

âAfter âseveral âmore âyears âof âteaching , âI âcame âto âthe âconclusion âthat âwhat âwe âneed âin âeducation âis âa âmuch âbetter âunderstanding âof âstudents âand âlearning âfrom âa âmotiv ational âperspective , âfrom âa âpsychological âperspective .

âSo âI âleft âthe âclassroom , âand âI âwent âto âgraduate âschool âto âbecome âa âpsychologist .
âI âstarted âstudying âkids âand âadults âin âall âkinds âof âsuper âchallenging âsetting s , âand âin âevery âstudy âmy âquestion âwas , âwho âis âsuccessful âhere âand âwhy ?

âGr it âis âliving âlife âlike âit ' s âa âmarathon , ânot âa âspr int .

âIn âfact , âin âour âdata , âgr it âis âusually âun related âor âeven âin ver sely ârelated âto âmeasures âof âtalent .
âSo âfar , âthe âbest âidea âI ' ve âheard âabout âbuilding âgr it âin âkids âis âsomething âcalled â" grow th âmindset ."
âThis âis âan âidea âdeveloped âat âStanford âUniversity âby âCarol âD we ck , âand âit âis âthe âbelief âthat âthe âability âto âlearn âis ânot âfixed , âthat âit âcan âchange âwith âyour âeffort .

âX av ier âV il alt a : âArchite cture âat âhome âin âits âcommunity
âMy âwork âfocus es âon âthe âconnection âof âboth âthinking âabout âour âcommunity âlife âbeing âpart âof âthe âenvironment âwhere âarchitecture âgrows âfrom âthe ânatural âlocal âconditions âand âtraditions .
âToday âI âbrought âtwo ârecent âprojects âas âan âexample âof âthis .
âBoth âprojects âare âin âemerging âcountries , âone âin âEthiopia âand âanother âone âin âTunis ia .
âAnd âalso âthey âhave âin âcommon âthat âthe âdifferent âanalys es âfrom âdifferent âperspectives âbecomes âan âessential âpart âof âthe âfinal âpiece âof âarchitecture .
âThe âfirst âexample âstarted âwith âan âinvitation âto âdesign âa âmult ist ory âshopping âmall âin âEthiopia ' s âcapital âcity âAd dis âAb aba .
âAnd âthis âis âthe âtype âof âbuilding âwe âwere âshown âas âan âexample , âto âmy âteam âand âmyself , âof âwhat âwe âhad âto âdesign .
âAt âfirst , âthe âfirst âthing âI âthought âwas , âI âwant âto ârun âaway .
âAfter âseeing âa âfew âof âthese âbuildings â-- âthere âare âmany âin âthe âcity â-- âwe ârealized âthat âthey âhave âthree âvery âbig âpoints .
âFirst , âthese âbuildings , âthey âare âalmost âempty âbecause âthey âhave âvery âlarge âshops âwhere âpeople âcannot âafford âto âbuy âthings .
âSecond , âthey âneed âtons âof âenergy âto âperform âbecause âof âthe âskin âtreatment âwith âglass âthat âcreates âheat âin âthe âinside , âand âthen âyou âneed âa âlot âof âcooling .
âIn âa âcity âwhere âthis âshouldn ' t âhappen âbecause âthey âhave âreally âmild âweather âthat âr anges âfrom â20 âto â25 âdegrees âthe âwhole âyear .
âAnd âthird âis âthat âtheir âimage âhas ânothing âto âdo âwith âAfrica âand âwith âEthiopia .
âIt âis âa âpity âin âa âplace âthat âhas âsuch ârich âculture âand âtraditions .
âAlso âduring âour âfirst âvisit âto âEthiopia , âI âwas âreally âcapt iv ated âby âthe âold âmerk ato âthat âis âthis âopen - air âstructure âwhere âthousands âof âpeople , âthey âgo âand âbuy âthings âevery âday âfrom âsmall âv end ors .
âAnd âalso âit âhas âthis âidea âof âthe âpublic âspace âthat âuses âthe âout do ors âto âcreate âactivity .
âSo âI âthought , âthis âis âwhat âI âreally âwant âto âdesign , ânot âa âshopping âmall .
âBut âthe âquestion âwas âhow âwe âcould âdo âa âmult ist ory , âcontemporary âbuilding âwith âthese âprinciples .
âThe ânext âchallenge âwas âwhen âwe âlooked âat âthe âsite , âthat âis , âin âa âreally âgrowing âarea âof âthe âcity , âwhere âmost âof âthese âbuildings âthat âyou âsee âin âthe âimage , âthey âwere ânot âthere .
âAnd âit ' s âalso âbetween âtwo âparallel âstreets âthat âdon ' t âhave âany âconnection âfor âhundreds âof âmeters .
âSo âthe âfirst âthing âwe âdid âwas âto âcreate âa âconnection âbetween âthese âtwo âstreets , âputting âall âthe âentr ances âof âthe âbuilding .
âAnd âthis âex ten ds âwith âan âincl ined âat ri um âthat âcreates âan âopen - air âspace âin âthe âbuilding âthat âself - pro te cts âitself âwith âits âown âshape âfrom âthe âsun âand âthe ârain .
âAnd âaround âthis âv oid âwe âplaced âthis âidea âof âthe âmarket âwith âsmall âshops , âthat âchange âin âeach âfloor âbecause âof âthe âshape âof âthe âv oid .
âI âalso âthought , âhow âto âclose âthe âbuilding ?
âAnd âI âreally âwanted âto âfind âa âsolution âthat âwould ârespond âto âthe âlocal âclimate âconditions .
âAnd âI âstarted âthinking âabout âthe âtext ile âlike âa âshell âmade âof âconcrete âwith âper for ations âthat âwould âlet âthe âair âin , âand âalso âthe âlight , âbut âin âa âfilter ed âway .
âAnd âthen âthe âinspiration âcame âfrom âthese âbeautiful âbuttons âof âthe âEthiop ian âwomen ' s âdress es .
âThat âthey âhave âfract al âgeometry âproperties âand âthis âhelped âme âto âshape âthe âwhole âfac ade .
âAnd âwe âare âbuilding âthat âwith âthese âsmall âpre f ab ric ated âpieces âthat âare âthe âwindows âthat âlet âthe âair âand âthe âlight âin âa âcontrolled âway âinside âthe âbuilding .
âAnd âthis âis âcomple mented âby âthese âsmall âcolored âglasses âthat âuse âthe âlight âfrom âthe âinside âof âthe âbuilding âto âlight âup âthe âbuilding âat ânight .
âWith âthese âideas âit âwas ânot âeasy âfirst âto âconvince âthe âdevelop ers âbecause âthey âwere âlike , â" This âis ânot âa âshopping âmall . âWe âdidn ' t âask âfor âthat ."
âBut âthen âwe âall ârealized âthat âthis âidea âof âthe âmarket âhappened âto âbe âa âlot âmore âprofitable âthan âthe âidea âof âthe âshopping âmall âbecause âbasically âthey âhad âmore âshops âto âsell .
âAnd âalso âthat âthe âidea âof âthe âfac ade âwas âmuch , âmuch âcheaper , ânot âonly âbecause âof âthe âmaterial âcompared âwith âthe âglass , âbut âalso âbecause âwe âdidn ' t âneed âto âhave âair âcondition ing âanymore .
âSo âwe âcreated âsome âbudget âsavings âthat âwe âused âto âimplement âthe âproject .
âAnd âthe âfirst âimplement ation âwas âto âthink âabout âhow âwe âcould âmake âthe âbuilding âself - s uff icient âin âterms âof âenergy âin âa âcity âthat âhas âelectricity âcuts âalmost âevery âday .
âSo âwe âcreated âa âhuge âasset âby âpl acing âphoto vol ta ics âthere âon âthe âroof .
âAnd âthen âunder âthose âpanels âwe âthought âabout âthe âroof âlike âa ânew âpublic âspace âwith âgathering âareas âand âbars âthat âwould âcreate âthis âurban âo asis .
âAnd âthese âpor ches âon âthe âroof , âall âtogether âthey âcollect âthe âwater âto âre use âfor âsanitation âon âthe âinside .
âHope fully âby âthe âbeginning âof ânext âyear , âbecause âwe âare âalready âon âthe âfifth âfloor âof âthe âconstruction .
âThe âsecond âexample âis âa âmaster âplan âof â2,000 âapartments âand âfacilities âin âthe âcity âof âTunis .
âAnd âfor âdoing âsuch âa âbig âproject , âthe âbiggest âproject âI ' ve âever âdesigned , âI âreally âneeded âto âunderstand âthe âcity âof âTunis , âbut âalso âits âsurround ings âand âthe âtradition âand âculture .
âDuring âthat âanalysis âI âpaid âspecial âattention âto âthe âmed ina âthat âis âthis â1,000 - year - old âstructure âthat âused âto âbe âclosed âby âa âwall , âopened âby âtw el ve âdifferent âg ates , âconnected âby âalmost âstraight âlines .
âWhen âI âwent âto âthe âsite , âthe âfirst âdesign âoperation âwe âdid âwas âto âextend âthe âexisting âstreets , âcreating â12 âinitial âblocks âsimilar âin âsize âand âcharacteristics âto âthe âones âwe âhave âin âBar cel ona âand âother âcities âin âEurope âwith âthese âcour ty ards .
âOn âtop âof âthat , âwe âselected âsome âstrategic âpoints âreminded âof âthis âidea âof âthe âg ates âand âconnecting âthem âby âstraight âlines , âand âthis âmod ified âthis âinitial âpattern .
âAnd âthe âlast âoperation âwas âto âthink âabout âthe âcell , âthe âsmall âcell âof âthe âproject , âlike âthe âapartment , âas âan âessential âpart âof âthe âmaster âplan .
âAnd âfor âthat âI âthought , âwhat âwould âbe âthe âbest âorientation âin âthe âMed iter rane an âclimate âfor âan âapartment ?
âAnd âit ' s ânorth - s outh , âbecause âit âcreates âa âthermal âdifference âbetween âboth âsides âof âthe âhouse âand âthen âa ânatural âvent ilation .
âSo âwe âoverl ap âa âpattern âthat âmakes âsure âthat âmost âof âthe âapartments âare âperfectly âor ien ted âin âthat âdirection .
âAnd âthis âis âthe âresult âthat âis âalmost âlike âa âcombination âof âthe âEuropean âblock âand âthe âArab âcity .
âIt âhas âthese âblocks âwith âcour ty ards , âand âthen âon âthe âground âfloor âyou âhave âall âthese âconnections âfor âthe âpedest rians .
âAnd âalso âit ârespond s âto âthe âlocal âregulations âthat âestablish âa âhigher âdensity âon âthe âupper âlevels âand âa âlower âdensity âon âthe âground âfloor .
âAnd âit âalso âreinfor ces âthis âidea âof âthe âg ates .
âThe âvolume âhas âthis âconnecting âshape âthat âsh ades âitself âwith âthree âdifferent âtypes âof âapartments âand âalso âlets âthe âlight âgo âon âthe âground âfloor âin âa âvery âdense âneighborhood âAnd âin âthe âcour ty ards âthere âare âthe âdifferent âfacilities , âsuch âas âa âg ym âand âa âkindergarten âand âclose âby , âa âseries âof âcommercial â[ sp aces ] âthat âbring âactivity âto âthe âground âfloor .
âThe âroof , âwhich âis âmy âfavorite âspace âof âthe âproject âis âalmost âlike âgiving âback âto âthe âcommunity âthe âspace âtaken âby âthe âconstruction .
âAnd âit ' s âwhere âall âthe âneighbors , âthey âcan âgo âup âand âsocial ize , âand âdo âactivities âsuch âas âhaving âa âtwo - kilometer ârun âin âthe âmorning , âjumping âfrom âone âbuilding âto âanother .
âThese âtwo âexamples , âthey âhave âa âcommon âapproach âin âthe âdesign âprocess .
âAnd âalso , âthey âare âin âemerging âcountries âwhere âyou âcan âsee âthe âcities âliterally âgrowing .
âIn âthese âcities , âthe âimpact âof âarchitecture âin âpeople ' s âlives âof âtoday âand âtomorrow âchanges âthe âlocal âcommunities âand âeconomies âat âthe âsame âspeed âas âthe âbuildings âgrow .
âFor âthis âreason , âI âsee âeven âmore âimportance âto âlook âat âarchitecture âfinding âsimple âbut âaffordable âsolutions âthat âenhance âthe ârelationship âbetween âthe âcommunity âand âthe âenvironment âand âthat âaim âto âconnect ânature âand âpeople .
âThank âyou âvery âmuch .
âTrust âis âon âthe âdecline , âand âwe âneed âto ârebuild âit . âThat ' s âa âcommonly âheard âsuggestion âfor âmaking âa âbetter âworld â... âbut , âsays âphilosopher âOn ora âO ' Ne ill , âwe âdon ' t âreally âunderstand âwhat âwe ' re âsuggesting . âShe âfl ips âthe âquestion , âshowing âus âthat âour âthree âmost âcommon âideas âabout âtrust âare âactually âmis dire cted . â & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;

âI âdon ' t âhave âan âover view .
âBut , âof âcourse , âI âcan âlook âat âthe âopinion âpoll s , âand âthe âopinion âpoll s âare âsupposed ly âthe âsource âof âa âbelief âthat âtrust âhas âdecl ined .
âWhen âyou âactually âlook âat âopinion âpoll s âacross âtime , âthere ' s ânot âmuch âevidence âfor âthat .
âThat ' s âto âsay , âthe âpeople âwho âwere âmist r usted â20 âyears âago , âprincip ally âjournalists âand âpoliticians , âare âstill âmist r usted .
âAnd âthe âpeople âwho âwere âhighly âtrusted â20 âyears âago âare âstill ârather âhighly âtrusted : âjudges , ânurses .
âThe ârest âof âus âare âin âbetween , âand âby âthe âway , âthe âaverage âperson âin âthe âstreet âis âalmost âexactly âmid way .
âBut âis âthat âgood âevidence ?
âWhat âopinion âpoll s ârecord âis , âof âcourse , âopinions .
âWhat âelse âcan âthey ârecord ?
âSo âthey ' re âlooking âat âthe âgeneric âattitudes âthat âpeople âreport âwhen âyou âask âthem âcertain âquestions .
âDo âyou âtrust âpoliticians ? âDo âyou âtrust âteachers ?
âNow âif âsomebody âsaid âto âyou , â" Do âyou âtrust âgreen gro cers ?
âDo âyou âtrust âfish m ong ers ?
âDo âyou âtrust âelementary âschool âteachers ?"
âyou âwould âprobably âbegin âby âsaying , â" To âdo âwhat ?"
âAnd âthat âwould âbe âa âperfectly âsensible âresponse .
âAnd âyou âmight âsay , âwhen âyou âunderstood âthe âanswer âto âthat , â" Well , âI âtrust âsome âof âthem , âbut ânot âothers ."
âThat ' s âa âperfectly ârational âthing .
âIn âshort , âin âour âreal âlives , âwe âseek âto âplace âtrust âin âa âdifferent iated âway .
âWe âdon ' t âmake âan âassumption âthat âthe âlevel âof âtrust âthat âwe âwill âhave âin âevery âinstance âof âa âcertain âtype âof âofficial âor âoffice - hol der âor âtype âof âperson âis âgoing âto âbe âuniform .
âI âmight , âfor âexample , âsay âthat âI âcertainly âtrust âa âcertain âelementary âschool âteacher âI âknow âto âteach âthe âre ception âclass âto âread , âbut âin âno âway âto âdrive âthe âschool âmin ib us .
âI âmight , âafter âall , âknow âthat âshe âwasn ' t âa âgood âdriver .
âI âmight âtrust âmy âmost âlo qu acious âfriend âto âkeep âa âconversation âgoing âbut ânot â-- âbut âperhaps ânot âto âkeep âa âsecret .
âSim ple .
âSo âif âwe ' ve âgot âthose âevidence âin âour âordinary âlives âof âthe âway âthat âtrust âis âdifferent iated , âwhy âdo âwe âsort âof âdrop âall âthat âintelligence âwhen âwe âthink âabout âtrust âmore âabstract ly ?
âI âthink âthe âpoll s âare âvery âbad âgu ides âto âthe âlevel âof âtrust âthat âactually âexists , âbecause âthey âtry âto âobl iterate âthe âgood âjudgment âthat âgoes âinto âpl acing âtrust .
âSecondly , âwhat âabout âthe âaim ?
âThe âaim âis âto âhave âmore âtrust .
âWell âfrankly , âI âthink âthat ' s âa âstupid âaim .
âIt ' s ânot âwhat âI âwould âaim âat .
âI âwould âaim âto âhave âmore âtrust âin âthe âtrust worthy âbut ânot âin âthe âunt r ust worthy .
âIn âfact , âI âaim âposit ively âto âtry ânot âto âtrust âthe âunt r ust worthy .
âAnd âI âthink , âof âthose âpeople âwho , âfor âexample , âplaced âtheir âsavings âwith âthe âvery âa pt ly ânamed âMr . âMad off , âwho âthen âmade âoff âwith âthem , âand âI âthink âof âthem , âand âI âthink , âwell , âyes , âtoo âmuch âtrust .
âMore âtrust âis ânot âan âintelligent âaim âin âthis âlife .
âIntell ig ently âplaced âand âintell ig ently ârefused âtrust âis âthe âproper âaim .
âWell âonce âone âsays âthat , âone âsays , âyeah , âokay , âthat âmeans âthat âwhat âmatters âin âthe âfirst âplace âis ânot âtrust âbut âtrust worth iness .
âIt ' s âjud ging âhow âtrust worthy âpeople âare âin âparticular ârespect s .
âAnd âI âthink âthat âjudgment ârequires âus âto âlook âat âthree âthings .
âAre âthey âcompe tent ? âAre âthey âhonest ? âAre âthey âreliable ?
âAnd âif âwe âfind âthat âa âperson âis âcompe tent âin âthe ârelevant âmatters , âand âreliable âand âhonest , âwe ' ll âhave âa âpretty âgood âreason âto âtrust âthem , âbecause âthey ' ll âbe âtrust worthy .
âBut âif , âon âthe âother âhand , âthey ' re âun rel iable , âwe âmight ânot .
âI âhave âfriends âwho âare âcompe tent âand âhonest , âbut âI âwould ânot âtrust âthem âto âpost âa âletter , âbecause âthey ' re âforget ful .
âI âhave âfriends âwho âare âvery âconfident âthey âcan âdo âcertain âthings , âbut âI ârealize âthat âthey âover est imate âtheir âown âcomp eten ce .
âAnd âI ' m âvery âglad âto âsay , âI âdon ' t âthink âI âhave âmany âfriends âwho âare âcompe tent âand âreliable âbut âextremely âdish on est .
âIf âso , âI âhaven ' t âyet âspot ted âit .
âBut âthat ' s âwhat âwe ' re âlooking âfor : âtrust worth iness âbefore âtrust .
âTrust âis âthe âresponse .
âTrust worth iness âis âwhat âwe âhave âto âjudge . âAnd , âof âcourse , âit ' s âdifficult .
âAc ross âthe âlast âfew âdecades , âwe ' ve âtried âto âconstruct âsystems âof âaccountability âfor âall âsorts âof âinstitutions âand âprofessionals âand âofficials âand âso âon âthat âwill âmake âit âeasier âfor âus âto âjudge âtheir âtrust worth iness .
âA âlot âof âthese âsystems âhave âthe âcon verse âeffect .
âThey âdon ' t âwork âas âthey ' re âsupposed âto .
âI âremember âI âwas âtalking âwith âa âmid w ife âwho âsaid , â" Well , âyou âsee , âthe âproblem âis âit âtakes âlonger âto âdo âthe âpaper work âthan âto âdeliver âthe âbaby ."
âAnd âall âover âour âpublic âlife , âour âinstitutional âlife , âwe âfind âthat âproblem , âthat âthe âsystem âof âaccountability âthat âis âmeant âto âsecure âtrust worth iness âand âevidence âof âtrust worth iness âis âactually âdoing âthe âopposite .
âIt âis âdistra cting âpeople âwho âhave âto âdo âdifficult âtasks , âlike âmid w ives , âfrom âdoing âthem âby ârequ iring âthem âto âtick âthe âboxes , âas âwe âsay .
âYou âcan âall âgive âyour âown âexamples âthere .
âSo âso âmuch âfor âthe âaim .
âThe âaim , âI âthink , âis âmore âtrust worth iness , âand âthat âis âgoing âto âbe âdifferent âif âwe âare âtrying âto âbe âtrust worthy âand âcommunicate âour âtrust worth iness âto âother âpeople , âand âif âwe âare âtrying âto âjudge âwhether âother âpeople âor âoffice - holders âor âpoliticians âare âtrust worthy .
âIt ' s ânot âeasy . âIt âis âjudgment , âand âsimple âreaction , âattitudes , âdon ' t âdo âade qu ately âhere .
âNow âthird ly , âthe âtask .
âCall ing âthe âtask âreb uilding âtrust , âI âthink , âalso âgets âthings âbackwards .
âIt âsuggests âthat âyou âand âI âshould ârebuild âtrust .
âWell , âwe âcan âdo âthat âfor âourselves .
âWe âcan ârebuild âa âbit âof âtrust worth iness .
âWe âcan âdo âit âtwo âpeople âtogether âtrying âto âimprove âtrust .
âBut âtrust , âin âthe âend , âis âdistinct ive âbecause âit ' s âgiven âby âother âpeople .
âYou âcan ' t ârebuild âwhat âother âpeople âgive âyou .
âYou âhave âto âgive âthem âthe âbasis âfor âgiving âyou âtheir âtrust .
âSo âyou âhave âto , âI âthink , âbe âtrust worthy .
âAnd âthat , âof âcourse , âis âbecause âyou âcan ' t âfool âall âof âthe âpeople âall âof âthe âtime , âusually .
âBut âyou âalso âhave âto âprovide âus able âevidence âthat âyou âare âtrust worthy .
âHow âto âdo âit ?
âWell âevery âday , âall âover âthe âplace , âit ' s âbeing âdone âby âordinary âpeople , âby âofficials , âby âinstitutions , âquite âeffectively .
âLet âme âgive âyou âa âsimple âcommercial âexample .
âThe âshop âwhere âI âbuy âmy âso cks âsays âI âmay âtake âthem âback , âand âthey âdon ' t âask âany âquestions .

âThat ' s âsuper . âI âtrust âthem âbecause âthey âhave âmade âthemselves âvulnerable âto âme .
âI âthink âthere ' s âa âbig âlesson âin âthat .
âIf âyou âmake âyourself âvulnerable âto âthe âother âparty , âthen âthat âis âvery âgood âevidence âthat âyou âare âtrust worthy âand âyou âhave âconfidence âin âwhat âyou âare âsaying .
âSo âin âthe âend , âI âthink âwhat âwe âare âaim ing âfor âis ânot âvery âdifficult âto âdisc ern .
âIt âis ârelationships âin âwhich âpeople âare âtrust worthy âand âcan âjudge âwhen âand âhow âthe âother âperson âis âtrust worthy .
âSo âthe âmoral âof âall âthis âis , âwe âneed âto âthink âmuch âless âabout âtrust , âlet âalone âabout âattitudes âof âtrust âdetected âor âmis - dete cted âby âopinion âpoll s , âmuch âmore âabout âbeing âtrust worthy , âand âhow âyou âgive âpeople âade quate , âuseful âand âsimple âevidence âthat âyou ' re âtrust worthy .

â70 âpercent âdon ' t âwork , âdon ' t âgo âto âschool .
âThey âpretty âmuch âdo ânothing .
âI âwent âback âto âM og ad ish u âlast âmonth , âand âI âwent âto âvisit âMad ina âHospital , âthe âhospital âI âwas âborn âin .
âI âremember âstanding âin âfront âof âthat âbullet - r idden âhospital âthinking , âwhat âif âI âhad ânever âleft ?
âWhat âif âI âhad âbeen âforced âinto âthat âsame âstate âof âwa ith ood ?
âWould âI âhave âbecome âa âterrorist ?
âI ' m ânot âreally âsure âabout âthe âanswer .
âMy âreason âfor âbeing âin âM og ad ish u âthat âmonth âwas âactually âto âhost âa âyouth âleadership âand âentrepreneurs hip âsummit .
âI âbrought âtogether âabout â90 âyoung âSom ali âleaders .
âWe âsat âdown âand âbrainstorm ed âon âsolutions âto âthe âbiggest âchallenges âfacing âtheir âcity .
âOne âof âthe âyoung âmen âin âthe âroom âwas âA den .
âHe âwent âto âuniversity âin âM og ad ish u , âgraduated .
âThere âwere âno âjobs , âno âopportunities .
âI âremember âhim âtelling âme , âbecause âhe âwas âa âcollege âgraduate , âunemploy ed , âfrustrated , âthat âhe âwas âthe âperfect âtarget âfor âal âSh aba ab âand âother âterrorist âorganizations , âto âbe ârecru ited .
âThey âsought âpeople âlike âhim âout .
âBut âhis âstory âtakes âa âdifferent âroute .
âIn âM og ad ish u , âthe âbiggest âbarrier âto âgetting âfrom âpoint âA âto âpoint âB âare âthe âroads .
âTwenty - three âyears âof âcivil âwar âhave âcompletely âdestroyed âthe âroad âsystem , âand âa âmot orb ike âcan âbe âthe âeasiest âway âto âget âaround .
âA den âsaw âan âopportunity âand âse ized âit .
âHe âstarted âa âmot orb ike âcompany .
âHe âbegan ârent ing âout âmot orb ikes âto âlocal âresidents âwho âcouldn ' t ânormally âafford âthem .
âHe âbought â10 âb ikes , âwith âthe âhelp âof âfamily âand âfriends , âand âhis âdream âis âto âeventually âexpand âto âseveral âhundred âwithin âthe ânext âthree âyears .
âHow âis âthis âstory âdifferent ?
âWhat âmakes âhis âstory âdifferent ?
âI âbelieve âit âis âhis âability âto âidentify âand âse ize âa ânew âopportunity .
âIt ' s âentrepreneurs hip , âand âI âbelieve âentrepreneurs hip âcan âbe âthe âmost âpowerful âtool âagainst âwa ith ood .
âIt âemp owers âyoung âpeople âto âbe âthe âcreat ors âof âthe âvery âeconomic âopportunities âthey âare âso âdesperately âseeking .
âAnd âyou âcan âtrain âyoung âpeople âto âbe âentrepreneurs .
âI âwant âto âtalk âto âyou âabout âa âyoung âman âwho âat tended âone âof âmy âmeetings , âMoh amed âMoh am oud , âa âfl or ist .
âHe âwas âhelping âme âtrain âsome âof âthe âyoung âpeople âat âthe âsummit âin âentrepreneurs hip âand âhow âto âbe âinnovative âand âhow âto âcreate âa âculture âof âentrepreneurs hip .
âHe ' s âactually âthe âfirst âfl or ist âM og ad ish u âhas âseen âin âover â22 âyears , âand âuntil ârecently , âuntil âMoh amed âcame âalong , âif âyou âwanted âflowers âat âyour âwedding , âyou âused âplastic âb ou qu ets âshipped âfrom âabroad .
âIf âyou âasked âsomeone , â" When âwas âthe âlast âtime âyou âsaw âfresh âflowers ?" âfor âmany âwho âgrew âup âunder âcivil âwar , âthe âanswer âwould âbe , â" N ever ."
âSo âMoh amed âsaw âan âopportunity .
âHe âstarted âa âlands cap ing âand âdesign âfl oral âcompany .
âHe âcreated âa âfarm âright âoutside âof âM og ad ish u , âand âstarted âgrowing ât ul ips âand âl il ies , âwhich âhe âsaid âcould âsurvive âthe âharsh âM og ad ish u âclimate .
âAnd âhe âbegan âdelivering âflowers âto âwed dings , âcreating âgardens âat âhomes âand âbusinesses âaround âthe âcity , âand âhe ' s ânow âworking âon âcreating âM og ad ish u ' s âfirst âpublic âpark âin â22 âyears .
âThere ' s âno âpublic âpark âin âM og ad ish u .
âHe âwants âto âcreate âa âspace âwhere âfamilies , âyoung âpeople , âcan âcome âtogether , âand , âas âhe âsays , âsmell âthe âpro verb ial âro ses .
âAnd âhe âdoesn ' t âgrow âro ses âbecause âthey âuse âtoo âmuch âwater , âby âthe âway .
âSo âthe âfirst âstep âis âto âinspire âyoung âpeople , âand âin âthat âroom , âMoh amed ' s âpresence âhad âa âreally âprofound âimpact âon âthe âyouth âin âthat âroom .
âThey âhad ânever âreally âthought âabout âstarting âup âa âbusiness .
âThey ' ve âthought âabout âworking âfor âan âNGO , âworking âfor âthe âgovernment , âbut âhis âstory , âhis âinnovation , âreally âhad âa âstrong âimpact âon âthem .
âHe âforced âthem âto âlook âat âtheir âcity âas âa âplace âof âopportunity .
âHe âempowered âthem âto âbelieve âthat âthey âcould âbe âentrepreneurs , âthat âthey âcould âbe âchange âmakers .
âBy âthe âend âof âthe âday , âthey âwere âcoming âup âwith âinnovative âsolutions âto âsome âof âthe âbiggest âchallenges âfacing âtheir âcity .
âThey âcame âup âwith âentrepreneurial âsolutions âto âlocal âproblems .
âSo âinspiring âyoung âpeople âand âcreating âa âculture âof âentrepreneurs hip âis âa âreally âgreat âstep , âbut âyoung âpeople âneed âcapital âto âmake âtheir âideas âa âreality .
âThey âneed âexpertise âand âment ors hip âto âguide âthem âin âdeveloping âand âlaunching âtheir âbusinesses .
âConnect âyoung âpeople âwith âthe âresources âthey âneed , âprovide âthem âthe âsupport âthey âneed âto âgo âfrom âide ation âto âcreation , âand âyou âwill âcreate âcat alyst s âfor âurban âgrowth .
âFor âme , âentrepreneurs hip âis âmore âthan âjust âstarting âup âa âbusiness .
âIt ' s âabout âcreating âa âsocial âimpact .
âMoh amed âis ânot âsimply âselling âflowers .
âI âbelieve âhe âis âselling âhope .
âHis âPeace âPark , âand âthat ' s âwhat âhe âcalls âit , âwhen âit ' s âcreated , âwill âactually âtransform âthe âway âpeople âsee âtheir âcity .
âA den âhired âstreet âkids âto âhelp ârent âout âand âmaintain âthose âb ikes âfor âhim .
âHe âgave âthem âthe âopportunity âto âescape âthe âpar alysis âof âwa ith ood .
âThese âyoung âentrepreneurs âare âhaving âa âtremendous âimpact âin âtheir âcities .
âSo âmy âsuggestion âis , âturn âyouth âinto âentrepreneurs , âincub ate âand ânurt ure âtheir âinherent âinnovation , âand âyou âwill âhave âmore âstories âof âflowers âand âPeace âParks âthan âof âcar âbombs âand âwa ith ood .

âIn âthis âshort âtalk , âFellow âSarah âPar c ak âintrodu ces âthe âfield âof â" space âar che ology " â-- âusing âsatellite âimages âto âsearch âfor âclues âto âthe âlost âsites âof âpast âcivilizations .

âWhen âI âwas âa âchild âgrowing âup âin âMa ine , âone âof âmy âfavorite âthings âto âdo âwas âto âlook âfor âsand âdollars âon âthe âse ash ores âof âMa ine , âbecause âmy âparents âtold âme âit âwould âbring âme âluck .
âBut âyou âknow , âthese âshell s , âthey ' re âhard âto âfind .
âThey ' re âcovered âin âsand . âThey ' re âdifficult âto âsee .
âHowever , âover time , âI âgot âused âto âlooking âfor âthem .
âI âstarted âseeing âshapes âand âpatterns âthat âhelped âme âto âcollect âthem .
âThis âgrew âinto âa âpassion âfor âfinding âthings , âa âlove âfor âthe âpast âand âarch ae ology .
âAnd âeventually âwhen âI âstarted âstudying âEgypt ology , âI ârealized âthat âseeing âwith âmy ânaked âeyes âalone âwasn ' t âenough .
âBecause âall âof âthe âsudden âin âEgypt âmy âbeach âhad âgrown âfrom âa âtiny âbeach âin âMa ine âto âone âeight âhundred âmiles âlong ânext âto âthe âN ile , âand âmy âsand âdollars âhad âgrown âto âthe âsize âof âcities .
âThis âis âreally âwhat âbrought âme âto âusing âsatellite âimagery .
âFor âtrying âto âmap âthe âpast , âI âknew âthat âI âhad âto âsee âdifferently .
âSo âI âwant âto âshow âyou âan âexample âof âhow âwe âsee âdifferently âusing âthe âinfrared .
âThis âis âa âsite âlocated âin âthe âeastern âEgyptian âd elta âcalled âB end ix .
âAnd âthe âsite âvis ibly âappears âbrown , âbut âwhen âwe âuse âthe âinfrared âand âwe âprocess âit , âall âof âthe âsudden , âusing âfalse âcolor , âthe âsite âappears âas âbright âpink .
âWhat âyou âare âseeing âare âthe âactual âchemical âchanges âto âthe âlandscape âcaused âby âthe âbuilding âmaterials âand âactivities âof âthe âancient âEgypt ians .
âWhat âI âwant âto âshare âwith âyou âtoday âis âhow âwe ' ve âused âsatellite âdata âto âfind âan âancient âEgyptian âcity , âcalled âIt j t aw y , âmissing âfor âthousands âof âyears .
âIt j t aw y âwas âancient âEgypt ' s âcapital âfor âover âfour âhundred âyears , âat âa âperiod âof âtime âcalled âthe âMiddle âKingdom âabout âfour âthousand âyears âago .
âThe âsite âis âlocated âin âthe âF ai y um âof âEgypt âand âsite âis âreally âimportant âbecause âin âthe âMiddle âKingdom âthere âwas âthis âgreat âr enaissance âfor âancient âEgyptian âart , âarchitecture âand âreligion .
âEgypt ologists âhave âalways âknown âthe âsite âof âIt j t aw y âwas âlocated âsomewhere ânear âthe âpyram ids âof âthe âtwo âk ings âwho âbuilt âit , âindic ated âwithin âthe âred âcircles âhere , âbut âsomewhere âwithin âthis âmassive âflood âplane .
âThis âarea âis âhuge â-- âit ' s âfour âmiles âby âthree âmiles âin âsize .
âThe âN ile âused âto âflow âright ânext âto âthe âcity âof âIt j t aw y , âand âas âit âshifted âand âchanged âand âmoved âover âtime âto âthe âeast , âit âcovered âover âthe âcity .
âSo , âhow âdo âyou âfind âa âburied âcity âin âa âvast âlandscape ?
âF inding âit ârandomly âwould âbe âthe âequivalent âof âloc ating âa âneedle âin âa âha y st ack , âblind fold ed âwearing âbaseball âmit ts .
âSo âwhat âwe âdid âis âwe âused âNASA âtop ography âdata âto âmap âout âthe âlandscape , âvery âsubtle âchanges .
âWe âstarted âto âbe âable âto âsee âwhere âthe âN ile âused âto âflow .
âBut âyou âcan âsee âin âmore âdetail â-- âand âeven âmore âinteresting â-- âthis âvery âslight âraised âarea âseen âwithin âthe âcircle âup âhere , âwhich âwe âthought âcould âpossibly âbe âthe âlocation âof âthe âcity âof âIt j t aw y .
âSo âwe âcollabor ated âwith âthe âEgyptian âscientists âto âdo âcor ing âwork , âwhich âyou âsee âhere .
âWhen âI âsay âcor ing , âit ' s âlike âice âcor ing , âbut âinstead âof âlayers âof âclimate âchange âyou ' re âlooking âfor âlayers âof âhuman âoccup ation .
âAnd âfive âmeters âdown , âunderneath âa âthick âlayer âof âmud , âwe âfound âa âdense âlayer âof âpot tery .
âWhat âthis âshows âis âthat âat âthis âpossible âlocation âof âIt j t aw y , âfive âmeters âdown , âwe âhave âof âlayer âof âoccup ation âfor âseveral âhundred âyears âdating âto âthe âMiddle âKingdom , âdating âto âthe âexact âperiod âof âtime âwe âthink âIt j t aw y âis .
âWe âalso âfound âwork âstone â-- âc arn el ian , âqu artz âand âag ate âthat âshows âthat âthere âwas âa âjewel ers âworks hop âhere .
âThese âmight ânot âlook âlike âmuch , âbut âwhen âyou âthink âabout âthe âmost âcommon âstones âused âin âjewelry âfrom âthe âMiddle âKingdom , âthese âare âthe âstones âthat âwere âused .
âSo , âwe âhave âa âdense âlayer âof âoccup ation âdating âto âthe âMiddle âKingdom âat âthis âsite .
âWe âalso âhave âevidence âof âan âelite âjewel ers âworks hop , âshowing âthat âwhatever âwas âthere âwas âa âvery âimportant âcity .
âNo âIt j t aw y âwas âhere âyet , âbut âwe ' re âgoing âto âbe âreturning âto âthe âsite âin âthe ânear âfuture âto âmap âit âout .
âAnd âeven âmore âimportantly , âwe âhave âfunding âto âtrain âyoung âEgypt ians âin âthe âuse âof âsatellite âtechnology âso âthey âcan âbe âthe âones âmaking âgreat âdiscoveries âas âwell .
âSo âI âwanted âto âend âwith âmy âfavorite âquote âfrom âthe âMiddle âKingdom â-- âit âwas âprobably âwritten âat âthe âcity âof âIt j t aw y âfour âthousand âyears âago .
â" Sh aring âknowledge âis âthe âgreatest âof âall âcall ings .
âThere ' s ânothing âlike âit âin âthe âland ."
âSo âas âit âturns âout , âTED âwas ânot âfounded âin â1984 âAD .

âGrow ing âup âin âTaiwan âas âthe âdaughter âof âa âcall ig ra pher , âone âof âmy âmost âtre asure d âmemories âwas âmy âmother âshowing âme âthe âbeauty , âthe âshape âand âthe âform âof âChinese âcharacters .
âEver âsince âthen , âI âwas âfascinated âby âthis âincredible âlanguage .
âBut âto âan âouts ider , âit âseems âto âbe âas âimp en etra ble âas âthe âGreat âWall âof âChina .

âI âlearned ânew âcharacters âevery âday âduring âthe âcourse âof âthe ânext â15 âyears .
âSince âwe âonly âhave âfive âminutes , âit ' s âbetter âthat âwe âhave âa âfast âand âsimpler âway .

âSo âwe âhave âgone âthrough âalmost â30 âcharacters .
âBy âusing âthis âmethod , âthe âfirst âeight âradical s âwill âallow âyou âto âbuild â3 2.
âThe ânext âgroup âof âeight âcharacters âwill âbuild âan âextra â3 2.

âThe âcharacter âon âthe âleft âis âtwo âmountains âstack ed âon âtop âof âeach âother .
âIn âancient âChina , âthat âmeans âin âex ile , âbecause âChinese âem per ors , âthey âput âtheir âpolitical âenemies âin âex ile âbeyond âmountains .
âNow adays , âex ile âhas âturned âinto âgetting âout .
